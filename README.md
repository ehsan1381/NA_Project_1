# Numerical Analysis project 1
This is program of the second problem.







# TODO
- [ ] Describe where do the formulas for computing boundary conditions come from
    Using a symbolic calculator given $n=0$ and $n=1$. These two values for $n$ were chosen because
    the function is defined for these values under the constraint that we keep $n$ non-negative
- [ ] Describe reason behind choosing to write RecurrenceRelation as an individual function and not
  an inline
    This enables us to individually test and debug this portion of the program.

- [ ] Add problem statement
- [ ] Main decisions
    Choice of language, variable types, programming method, etc.
